Damn Vulnerable Web Sockets (DVWS) is a deliberately vulnerable and insecure web application which works on web sockets for client-server communication. It is built on PHP with Ratchet and utilizes MySQL as backend database. It allows users to test their web sockets testing skills, tools and scripts for web socket vulnerabilities. Web socket testing can be performed using popular tools such as OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite.
